How To Add Presets!

===Preamble===
Firstly, understand that presets are intended to be hand-crafted experiences for the start of the game, all bundled in a json file.
If you simply want to change a pre-existing preset's settings, it may be easier to just copy what it sets in-game and modify away.
Secondly, a preset should ideally give the player everything they need to start the game at that existing location and survive.
A lot of the items normally in the Safe Shallows can’t be found deep underwater but are needed for creating batteries or fabricators to progress.
So it is recomended to take that into account in creating the item list.

===Creating A New Preset===
All files within the /Presets folder with a .json extension will be attempted to load at runtime. So this file will not, as it is a .txt.
To get started, copy and paste or duplicate one of the existing presets as a base for your new preset.
1. Generally, it should be quite simple to modify the true/false variables.
2. The storage size, though, must match one of the existing options in settings.
3. Do not modify the ConfigVersion unless you know what you are doing!
4. The name of the preset comes from the file name — so everything before .json.
5. Vanilla and modded items are both supported. The list of available vanilla names is at the end of this list.

===Modded Items===
Modded items require a little extra special sauce to get working properly.
Open up moddedExample.txt to view an example of a modded item (from lee23's PdaChips).  
NOTE: moddedExample.txt has a .txt extension to not be loaded into the game; change it to .json if you wish it to be loaded.
{
   "Name": "PdaMinimapUpgrade",
   "Quantity": 1,
   "IsModded": true,
   "ModGUID": "com.lee23.pdaupgradechips"
}
Each item has 2 extra fields that tell Life Pod Remastered to load it differently.
The `"IsModded": true` tells it to treat the item as modded and search for it through Nautilus.
"ModGUID" tells what mod the item is intended to come from. It is technically optional but is highly recommended for troubleshooting and for other users of the preset.
To get the ModGUID of any mod, use Lee23's Subnautica Mod Manager https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1168. It is by far the easiest way to get a loaded mod’s GUID.

===Vanilla Items===
These item IDs were generated from this page on the Subnautica wiki: https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Spawn_IDs_(Subnautica)
If an item ID listed doesn’t work here, try to find it on the wiki to double-check its accuracy.
